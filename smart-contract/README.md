# FRACTIONAL NFT SMART CONTRACT

Run the project with following steps:
- Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` file in this directory, and fill the `PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key from your wallet.
- `npm install`
- `npx hardhat compile`
- `npx hardhat npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`

Store the smart contracts addresses that displayed on the terminal. We will need those later.
